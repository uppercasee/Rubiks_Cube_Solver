## Introduction
The Rubik's Cube Solver is an interactive and visually captivating project developed using the Processing programming language. This solver aims to provide an automated solution to solve the classic Rubik's Cube puzzle. It offers a 3D visualization of the cube's movements as it rearranges itself to reach the solved state.

## Features
- 3D visualization of a Rubik's Cube in a 3x3x3 grid
- Automated solving algorithm using pre-defined moves
- Interactive camera control with PeasyCam library
- Engaging and captivating animations
